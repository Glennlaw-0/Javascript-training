# Javascript-training
This is my first time learning Javascript in its totality.

I started off learning Javascript by doing Cole Steele's Web development bootcamp and also with a book called 'A Smarter Way to Learn Javascript' by Mark Myers. Both resources have helped me get the gist of understanding why Html, css, and Javascript work together. 

As I mentioned before, I got the gist of each tool to use but I didnt really feel confident. So I am now learning Javascript by Shaun Pelling (The Net Ninja).

I've taken notes in each Javascript file so that you can see how i've studied each chapter.
